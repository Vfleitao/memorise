Memorize Source Available License (MSAL) v1.0

TERMS AND CONDITIONS
=============================================================================

1. DEFINITIONS

   "Software" refers to the Memorize source code, documentation, and any
   associated materials in this repository.

   "Derivative Work" means any modification, enhancement, bug fix, or feature
   addition to the Software.

   "Cache Service Business" means a business that sells caching, key-value
   storage, or similar data storage services as its primary product offering,
   comparable to Redis Cloud, Amazon ElastiCache, Azure Cache, or similar.

   "Internal Use" means use of the Software within your organization or as
   a component of your applications, where caching is not the product being sold.

2. GRANT OF RIGHTS

   Subject to the terms of this License, you are granted a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to:

   a) Use the Software for any purpose, including commercial Internal Use.

   b) Copy, modify, and create Derivative Works of the Software.

   c) Distribute the Software and Derivative Works, provided you comply
      with the Contribution and Attribution requirements below.

3. CONTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT

   If you create any Derivative Work that adds features, fixes bugs, or
   improves the Software in any way, you must:

   a) Make a good-faith effort to contribute those changes back to the
      original project by submitting a pull request or equivalent
      contribution within 90 days of deployment to production use.

   b) License your contributions under the same terms as this License.

   This requirement applies to modifications you make, not to separate
   software that merely interfaces with or uses the Software as a dependency.

4. ATTRIBUTION REQUIREMENT

   Any use or distribution of the Software or Derivative Works must include:

   a) This License file in its entirety.

   b) Prominent attribution stating: "Powered by Memorize" or equivalent,
      visible in documentation, about pages, or startup logs.

   c) A link to the original project repository where reasonably practical.

5. COMMERCIAL CACHE SERVICE RESTRICTION

   You may NOT offer the Software or any Derivative Work as a standalone
   cache service product without a separate commercial license agreement.

   This restriction applies specifically to businesses whose product IS a
   caching service (competing with Redis, Memcached, or similar offerings).

   Examples requiring a commercial license:
   - Offering "Memorize Cache" as a managed cloud service (like Azure Cache)
   - Selling Memorize as a caching platform or infrastructure product
   - Operating a caching-as-a-service business using this Software

   Examples that DO NOT require a commercial license:
   - Building an e-commerce app that uses Memorize as its cache layer
   - Creating a SaaS product that uses Memorize internally
   - Selling software that includes Memorize as a component
   - Any business where caching is not the product being sold

   In short: if you're selling an application that USES a cache, you're fine.
   If you're selling the cache itself as a service, contact us for a license.

   To obtain a commercial license, contact the project maintainers.

6. NO WARRANTY AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

   THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
   IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,

   a) Any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, or consequential
      damages arising from the use or inability to use the Software, including
      but not limited to: loss of data, loss of profits, business interruption,
      or any other commercial damages or losses.

   b) Any security vulnerabilities, bugs, or defects in the Software, whether
      known or unknown at the time of use. Users are solely responsible for
      evaluating the security and suitability of the Software for their needs.

   c) Any data breaches, unauthorized access, or security incidents that may
      occur while using the Software. It is the user's responsibility to
      implement appropriate security measures and conduct security audits.

      to hacking, exploitation of vulnerabilities, or malicious use.

   ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE.

   Users are strongly encouraged to:
   - Conduct their own security assessments before deployment
   - Keep the Software updated to the latest version
   - Implement defense-in-depth security practices
   - Not expose the Software to untrusted networks without proper safeguards

7. TERMINATION

   This License automatically terminates if you fail to comply with its terms.
